<section id="about">
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Hi, I’m Elle! I'm a licensed Doctor of Physical Therapy with certifications in holistic health, personal training, health coaching, ADHD coaching, and Reiki energy healing. I help people reconnect with their bodies, energy, and purpose through personalized care and grounded healing work.</p>
  <p>With a deep respect for science and spirit, I guide clients in bridging the gap between conventional care and healing at the soul level. Whether you’re navigating life's ups and downs, managing chronic illness, or simply seeking more alignment, I’m here to support your transformation.</p>
  <p>Healing Beach was born out of my desire to hold space for the ebb and flow of growth and restoration. This is my way of branching out to bring wellness to those who seek it across the globe. When I’m not working with clients, you’ll probably find me enjoying the ocean breeze, creating something with my hands, or caring for my turtle, dog, and many fish.</p>
